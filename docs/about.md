Hi, I'm Michael! I am senior currently pursuing my BS/MS in computer science at Yale University where I am fortunate to conduct research with Prof. [Anurag Khandelwal](https://www.anuragkhandelwal.com/) on memory tiering with CXL. My interests include distributed systems, heterogeneous memory architecture, and hardware accelerators.

I am originally from St. Louis, and when not in class, you can find me running, playing water polo, or desperately trying to resuscitate my sourdough starter.
